## Basics & concepts
- Lib use modified [ResetCss](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) by Eric Meyer
- "Wild" use flexbox and "border-box sizing" model
- Library is "auto-responsive" - its means that it tries to not to use media queries or minimize them.
Also layout components try to set all markup on different devices by default.
